# Accessing Endpoints

## Quick access

For quick access there is a convenient "link" button on the home page next to each endpoint:

You can also click the "view" button on the right and see the actual path to use when replacing URLs in your application. The proper syntax is `https://app.trythrottlr.com/endpoints/{throttlr-path}?key={your-api-key}`

## API Keys

Accessing endpoints is done per API key. _<mark style="color:red;">**So keep yours private.**</mark>_ To help with this, all hyperlinks generated will be shortened _visually_. You may still right click them and copy in order to get the full link + api key for easy access. Other than this, your API key may be viewed under Settings, where you may also regenerate your API key or delete your account and all associated endpoints.
